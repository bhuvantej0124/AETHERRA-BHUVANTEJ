SEMI - AUTOMATIC MANHOLE CLEANING MACHINE 

OVERVIEW 

The semi-automatic maanhole cleaning Machine is safety-focused engineering solution devoloped to eleminate hazardoud manual manhole cleaning practices. 

The system enables remote removal of sludges and debris from manholes without human entry, ensuring improved safety, dignity, and efficiency for sanitation workers 
This project was devoloped as part of the SAMVED Hackathon 2026 under the themes Safety & Assistance for Sanitation Workers. 

problem statement

Safety & Assistance for Sanitation Workers 
Technology-enabled safety systems, alerts, health monitoring, and workflow optimization for sanitation workers operating in hazardous environments.
Manual manholoe cleaning exposes sanitation workers to toxic gases, infection, and life- threatening banning manual scavenging, unsafecleaning practice still exist due to lake of affordable and practical mechanized solutions.

proposed solution

The proroposed Semi-Automatic Manhole Cleaning Machine is a portable system consisting of:

1. A stable tripod structure
2. pulley and cable lifting machanism
3. Hand-crank or electric winch
4. clamshell grabber for waste extraction
The system allows sanitationj workers to remove waste remotely from manholoe, ensuring zero-enrty operation and minimizing health risks.

Innovation and Uniqueness

1. Zero- entry manhole cleaning machjanism
2. Portable and lightweight design
3. Machanical lift optimization for safe load handiling
4. Precision cleaning suitable for confined urban spaces
5. Intigration of gas detection for workers safety
6. Bridging the gap between manual labour and heavy machinary
